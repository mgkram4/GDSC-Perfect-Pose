# Perfect Form

Perfect Form is an AI-powered mobile application designed to help users improve their exercise form through real-time pose analysis and feedback.

## Project Overview

Perfect Form utilizes advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze users' exercise poses and provide instant feedback for improvement. The app aims to reduce the risk of injury and enhance the effectiveness of workouts by ensuring proper form.

## How It Works

1. **Pose Capture**: Users can upload photos or videos of themselves performing exercises using the app's intuitive interface.

2. **AI Analysis**: Our backend, powered by state-of-the-art machine learning models, analyzes the uploaded media to detect key body points and assess the user's pose.

3. **Feedback Generation**: Based on the AI analysis, the app generates personalized feedback, highlighting areas for improvement and suggesting corrections.

4. **Progress Tracking**: Users can view their history and track their improvement over time through comprehensive statistics and visualizations.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Pose Analysis**: Instant feedback on exercise form using advanced AI algorithms.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Tailored suggestions for improving form based on individual user data.
- **Exercise Library**: A comprehensive database of exercises with proper form demonstrations.
- **Progress Dashboard**: Visual representations of user progress and improvement over time.
- **Social Integration**: Optional sharing of achievements and progress with friends or a fitness community.

## Technical Architecture
